## Implementation of Quant GANs: Deep Generation of Financial Time Series, 2019

See main.ipynb for a replication of the [Wiese et al., Quant GANs: Deep Generation of Financial Time Series, 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.06673) paper.
- preprocess.ipynb contains various utility functions to compute the time-series statistics.
- the different model outputs are located in each of the folders.
